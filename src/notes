1. get all id's
2. siteid - check if the model exists - if not, return error
3. check other id's, if they exists, just add to exam, else create them
4. look for patientid - if patient doesn't exist, go back and create profile
5. if profile exists, but user doesnt, create users and a login account

- Existing => site, site notification, and site rules
- create exam
- from exam - directly create log-exams and views(?)
- indirectly look at patients/doctors and create profile/users/logins
- when user is created - create user site
- from site - create insurance
- when insurance and site is created, create user insurance
